| John Doe      |Computer Science| +/o/-          | Some words about what you liked, what not... |
| Patrick       |Computer Science| +              | I was missing some explanations on rebasing. Didn't have time to ask 
though. Other than that, it was a nice introduction into git :-) However, the wescale flow explanation was hard to follow and could be ditched next time in favor of more git hands-on. |
